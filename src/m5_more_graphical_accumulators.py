This module lets you practice one form of the ACCUMULATOR pattern,
namely, the "IN GRAPHICS" form which features:
  -- DRAWING OBJECTS via ACCUMULATING positions and/or sizes,
     as in:   x = x + pixels

Additionally, it emphasizes that you must
  ** DO A CONCRETE EXAMPLE BY HAND **
before you can implement a solution to the problem in Python.
